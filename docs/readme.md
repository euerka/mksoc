Just a small overview of the path from software --> cpu to fpga hostmot2 --> I/O pins

Going straight for an axi Interface would mean redesigning the top hostmot2.vhd
module splitting the (outside hps) address bus into 2(in / out).

So initially I have settled on using a basic Avalon interface as this is the most straight forward way to implement an I/O path with 1 16-bit adressbus and 2 unidirectional 32-bit data buses.

(!!.. I will have to to try improving this quick screenshot as it seems a bit flawed)

I would be an idea to build this hm2 top controller module into the qsys design as an ip core instead of having it hanging outside through a bus type interface port?
(having all this as 1 single separate basic design partition).

The link between the hm2 avalon interface ip (in qsys), the devicetree (dts-->dtb) entry, and link to getting memory mapped access in (linux) software is sketched out here:

[this script creates the following relevant headerfile](https://github.com/the-snowwhite/mksoc/blob/iotest/QuartusProjects/DE0_NANO_SOC_GHRD/generate_hps_qsys_header.sh#L1)

On the near future wish list is to implement partial re-configuration partions with the lower level hm2 modules, giving a more modular (hal like) approach to custom configuring.

Is done with a (mostly) solid unchanging interface structure giving "boxes / slots", block elements can be swapped in / out of....(think 4-8 partions at most) 

As an cusiosity I have put a axi3 MM Interface based (8-bit serial)streaming port, including a 11-12-bit memory mapped or so 32 bit(internaly) onchip memory demo ip into the design. This has a separate 3-address control register 1--> start address in ip ram, 2 --> end address, 3 --> start. 

[Both 2 pieces of device tree (in dtb) information needed to hook up an (uio style driver) link to mmap the I/O space](https://github.com/the-snowwhite/machinekit/blob/iotest/src/rtapi/socfpgadrv/hm2reg_uio-module.c#L275)

(there seems to be much less overhead needed here than all that clutter due to the other pci-based-interfaces)........
