User Space Driver Flow
1.
 The kernel space UIO device driver(s) must be loaded before the
user space driver is started (if using modules)
.config (line 1816)(kernel 4.15)
CONFIG_UIO=y
CONFIG_UIO_PDRV_GENIRQ=m

2.
 The user space application is started and the UIO device file is
opened (/dev/uioX where X is 0, 1, 2...)
â€“ From user space, the UIO device is a device node in the file system just like
any other device
3.
 The device memory address information is found from the relevant
sysfs directory, only the size is needed
4.
 The device memory is mapped into the process address space by
calling the mmap() function of the UIO driver
5.
 The application accesses the device hardware to control the device
6.
 The device memory is unmapped by calling munmap()
7.
 The UIO device file is closed
